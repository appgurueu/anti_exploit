# Exploit protection (`anti_exploit`)

Protects against exploits. Crucial for securing your server.

## About

Depends on [`modlib`](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib). Requires inventory images rendered using [`online_craftguide_csm`](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib) to work (which are not copied automatically). Code written by Lars Mueller aka LMD or appguru(eu) and licensed under the MIT license. Media (screenshot) by appguru as well and CC0. This mod is intended to be eventually incorporated into a superseding management mod.
